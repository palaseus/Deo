- **Mempool**: Manages pending transactions before inclusion in blocks

#### Key Features:
- Immutable block structure with cryptographic hashing
- Merkle tree implementation for transaction integrity
- UTXO-based transaction model
- Comprehensive transaction validation
- Block height and timestamp validation
- Chain reorganization support

### 2. Virtual Machine (`src/vm/`)

The virtual machine executes smart contracts and provides a secure execution environment:
